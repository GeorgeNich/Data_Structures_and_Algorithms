# SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms - Graphs

This repository contains solutions for Practical Task 9.1 (Pass Task) in the SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms course (Trimester 1, 2021) at Deakin University.

## Task Overview

In this task, the focus is on processing Graphs, and it involves answering a series of questions related to graph algorithms. The questions cover topics such as the running time of the depth-first search algorithm, advice on choosing between Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s algorithms, and drawing Depth-first and Breadth-first search trees.

## Task Questions

### 1. Running Time of Depth-First Search Algorithm

Given a graph 𝐺 ൌ 〈𝑉, 𝐸〉, what is the running time of the depth-first search algorithm, as a function of the number of nodes 𝑛 ൌ |𝑉| and edges 𝑚 ൌ |𝐸|, if the input graph is represented by an adjacency matrix instead of an adjacency list?

### 2. Choosing Between Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s Algorithms

Your colleague is looking for advice on choosing between Dijkstra’s algorithm (𝑂ሺ𝑉 ൅ 𝐸 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑉ሻ) and Floyd’s algorithm (𝑂ሺ𝑉ଷሻ, where |𝐸| ൑ |𝑉|
ଶ) for finding the shortest path. Discuss the factors to consider and under what circumstances your colleague should choose one algorithm over the other.

### 3. Drawing Search Trees

Given the provided graph, draw both the Depth-first and Breadth-first search trees that will result if you start at Node A. Note: when selecting between nodes, use alphabetical order.
