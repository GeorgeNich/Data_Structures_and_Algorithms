# Graphs

This repository contains solutions for Practical Task 9.1 (Pass Task) in the SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms course (Trimester 1, 2021) at Deakin University.

## Task Overview

In this task, the focus is on processing Graphs, and it involves answering a series of questions related to graph algorithms. The questions cover topics such as the running time of the depth-first search algorithm, advice on choosing between Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s algorithms, and drawing Depth-first and Breadth-first search trees.

## Task Questions

### 1. Running Time of Depth-First Search Algorithm

Given a graph, what is the running time of the depth-first search algorithm, as a function of the number of nodes and edges, if the input graph is represented by an adjacency matrix instead of an adjacency list?

### 2. Choosing Between Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s Algorithms

Discuss the factors to consider and under what circumstances your colleague should choose one algorithm over the other.

### 3. Drawing Search Trees

Given the provided graph, draw both the Depth-first and Breadth-first search trees that will result if you start at Node A. Note: when selecting between nodes, use alphabetical order.
