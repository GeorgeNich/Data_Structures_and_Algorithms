# Algorithm Complexity

This repository contains solutions for the Algorithm Complexity Practical Task in the SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms course (Trimester 1, 2021) at Deakin University.

## Task Overview

The Algorithm Complexity Practical Task focuses on using knowledge and skills related to algorithm space and time complexity to answer a series of questions. The objective is to analyze and classify algorithms based on their performance, considering factors such as best, worst, and average cases.

### Background

Efficiency in code execution depends on the choice of algorithms, especially as the amount of data increases. Complexity is defined as the time it takes to solve for an input size of 𝑛 elements, often expressed with the function 𝑇(𝑛). The evaluation of algorithm complexity involves removing individual implementation factors and focusing solely on the algorithm itself. This evaluation is achieved using methods such as Operation Counting, Asymptotic Notations, Substitution Method, Recurrence Tree, and Master Method.

### Questions

1. **Operation Counting**: For each of the six example algorithms provided in the table, answers were provided for sub-questions related to best, worst, and average cases, as well as Big-O, Big-Ω, and Big-𝛩 notations.

2. **Asymptotic Notation Discussion**: A discussion on why Big-O is more commonly used than Big-𝛩.

3. **Algorithm Runtimes**: A discussion on whether it is true that an 𝑛ଶ algorithm always takes longer to run than an 𝑛ଶlog 𝑛 algorithm.

4. **True or False Statements**: Answers to whether certain statements related to algorithm complexity are right or wrong.
