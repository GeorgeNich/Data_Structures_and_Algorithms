# AVL Trees Implementation

This repository contains the solutions for the AVL Trees Practical Task in the SIT221 Data Structures and Algorithms course (Trimester 1, 2021) at Deakin University.

## Task Overview

The AVL Trees Practical Task involves answering a series of questions related to AVL trees, including the insertion and deletion of values, as well as maintaining balance during these operations.

### Task Files

- **[AVL_Tree_Problems.pdf](AVL_Tree_Problems.pdf)**: Contains the detailed problem statement for the task.
- **[AVL_Tree_Solutions.pdf](AVL_Tree_Solutions.pdf)**: Provides solutions to the AVL Trees Practical Task.
- **[Readme.md](Readme.md)**: The README file for the repository.

## Task Solutions

### 1. Insertion of Values

#### Question 1

Draw a series of figures demonstrating the insertion of the values:
17, 13, 1, 8, 5, 11, 24, 27, 15, 6, 16

into an initially empty AVL tree. Insert the values in the order they appear in the given sequence.

- Show the resulting AVL tree immediately before and after each insertion step that causes the tree’s rebalancing.
- Calculate the balance degree and label each node of the AVL tree before and after the necessary rebalancing.
- Clearly indicate the node(s) at which rotation is performed.

*Include diagrams and explanations in your solution.*

### 2. Deletion of Values

#### Question 2

Draw a series of figures showing the deletion of the values:
17, 15, 11, 24, 27, 13, 16, 5, 6, 1, 8

from the AVL tree built in the previous part of the task.

*Include diagrams and explanations for each deletion and rotation (if any).*

### 3. Insertion Order for Balanced Tree

#### Question 3

What order should we insert the elements `[1, 2, … ,7]` into an empty AVL tree so that we do not have to perform any rotations on it?

*Provide an explanation for the insertion order.*
